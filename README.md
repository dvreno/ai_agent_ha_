# AI Agent HA Custom Integration
> ⚠️ This is an early-stage, proof-of-concept version of the integration. Features and stability may change as development progresses. Use with caution and provide feedback!

A Home Assistant custom component that provides an AI-powered agent capable of generating automations based on natural language queries. The agent connects to all entities in your Home Assistant instance and uses OpenAI, Llama, or Anthropic's Claude API to translate user requests into valid Home operations including creating automations for you!

---

## Features

* **Natural Language Automation**: Ask the agent to create automations in plain English.
* **Entity-Aware**: Automatically discovers and uses your existing Home Assistant entities.
* **UI Integration**: Manage and approve suggested automations directly from Home Assistant's UI (see screenshot below).
* **Dashboard Creation**: Build Lovelace dashboards and cards using natural language.
